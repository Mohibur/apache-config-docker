# Services are the parent of the container, container is a docker term
services:
# docker compose will create a image name `web`
  web:
    # we will use httpweb 
    # we will create httpweb image 
    # using docker command, see readme.md file for this
    image: httpweb
    # We will tell docker compose to map port 80, 
    # so that we can access from host machine
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      # I am creating another mapping for better understanding
      - "8080:80"
